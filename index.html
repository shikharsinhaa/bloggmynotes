<h1>Blogg My Notes</h1>
<p>On this site you will find all the resources you will need to get you through highschool. All content is either uploaded by myself or fellow curators on this site. To find relevant papers simply go to the 'Resources' tab and then click papers, you will find all of the papers you will need in that folder. If there are any missing files or answers, shoot me an email. You will find my email on the 'Contact' page. <br>
<br>
The main reason for the creation of this site is because I was struggling to find good resources for school work and if i did find something, I'd have to pay money and if it was free, it wasn't relevant to me. I'm constantly trying to improve and further expand the site by adding resources that aren't just math related. Also, I'm obviously trying to make the site look aesthetically pleasing because at the moment it's pretty shambolic if you ask me.The news section of the website is currently under development but we'll get there.<br>
<br>
My final message is use the resources wisely, do well in your exams and make sure you thank me! Only kidding about the last part, but do keep in mind I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE RESOURCES THAT I POST. I simply post resources that have been made by schools across NSW (Please do not sue me) Therefore don't claim any of these resources as your own. I fully own all code that has been used in this website.
